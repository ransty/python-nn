# python-nn
The goal of this neural network is to predict the output using backpropagation with a sigmoid function
All the synapses are given a random starting weight and backpropagation is used to update these weights after each iteration
The end result should be something close to the starting output (the more iterations, the closer the nn will be to the original output)
